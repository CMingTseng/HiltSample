Android application, to show how to use Hilt

The goals of Hilt are:
•To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps (70-75% less code lines).
•To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup, readability/understanding, and code sharing between apps.
•To provide an easy way to provision different bindings to various build types (e.g. testing, debug, or release).
